*Description:*<br />
Improve a landing page following the given design (same as
previous) by adding full responsiveness and some animation.<br />
*Requirements:*<br />
● The website should be partly responsive: <br />
Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s)  2560px (4K screens). <br />
Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content 
inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and 
centre it horizontally.<br />
● The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens <br />
● The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in 
any possible way, preferably with css properties 
(animation/transition).<br />
● Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS can’t be in 
just one-two files)<br />
● All of the previous work requirements must be kept.<br />
